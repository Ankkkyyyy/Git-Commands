# DVC (Data Version Control) & Git: Differences and Usage

## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It tracks changes in source code during software development and allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously.

### Key Features of Git
- **Version Control**: Track changes in code and manage different versions.
- **Branching and Merging**: Create branches to work on different features or fixes and merge them back into the main branch.
- **Distributed**: Every developer has the full history of the project, enabling offline work and reducing dependency on a central server.
- **Collaboration**: Easily collaborate with others through platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

### Usage
- **Initialization**: `git init`
- **Adding Changes**: `git add <file>`
- **Committing Changes**: `git commit -m "message"`
- **Pushing to Remote Repository**: `git push`
- **Pulling from Remote Repository**: `git pull`
- **Branching**: `git branch <branch-name>`
- **Merging**: `git merge <branch-name>`

## What is DVC?

DVC is an open-source version control system for machine learning projects. It helps manage and version large data files, models, and pipelines, integrating seamlessly with Git.

### Key Features of DVC
- **Data Versioning**: Track changes in large datasets and models.
- **Pipeline Management**: Define and run ML pipelines, tracking the full history.
- **Storage Agnostic**: Store data in different remote storage locations like AWS S3, Google Cloud, Azure, etc.
- **Reproducibility**: Ensure experiments are reproducible by tracking data, code, and pipelines.

### Usage
- **Initialization**: `dvc init`
- **Adding Data**: `dvc add <file>`
- **Tracking Data**: `dvc push`
- **Pulling Data**: `dvc pull`
- **Defining Pipelines**: `dvc run -n <stage-name> -d <dependencies> -o <outputs> <command>`
- **Visualizing Pipelines**: `dvc dag`

## Differences Between DVC and Git

- **Purpose**: 
  - **Git**: Manages version control for source code.
  - **DVC**: Manages version control for large datasets and machine learning models.
  
- **Data Handling**:
  - **Git**: Not optimized for large files or datasets.
  - **DVC**: Specifically designed to handle large files, datasets, and ML models.

- **Storage**:
  - **Git**: Uses local and remote repositories.
  - **DVC**: Can use various remote storage options like cloud storage.

- **Integration**:
  - **Git**: Focused on code versioning.
  - **DVC**: Integrates with Git to provide a complete version control system for ML projects.



This workflow ensures that your code and data are versioned and managed efficiently, supporting reproducibility and collaboration in machine learning projects.
